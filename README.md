This project uses reinforcement learning (RL) to train an agent to play a FlappyBird-like game.

Here is a video of it at <a href='https://youtu.be/3Y8ckBK8afw'>YouTube</a>

The algorithm used is called Q-Learning and jMonkeyEngine 3 is the game engine behind the game. 

Instead of a table populated with states and actions, a Map is used and it gets populated as the agent learns. The state-actions are used as the keys.
